title: "Young Scientists & ABM Talk Announcement"
---

Here is an invitation to our first online talk about Young Scientists & ABM. The Young Scientists (YS) group, a special interest group within the Asian Social Simulation Association (ASSA), cordially invites you to engage in a platform designed for communication, learning, and collaboration among aspiring researchers intrigued by social simulation.

In this talk, we will first invite Shaoni Wang, a postdoctoral researcher from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, to give a short talk about her ABM research journey. Following Shaoni's presentation, we encourage all participants to contribute to the conversation by sharing their perspectives on ABM. Whether it's recounting personal experiences, posing thought-provoking / “stupid” questions, brainstorming ideas for ABM applications, or anything else related to the topic, your input is valued.

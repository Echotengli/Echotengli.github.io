I am now a double-degree PhD candidate at [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/) (China) and [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) (The Netherlands).

My PhD project explores the collective consequences of bounded rationality in opinion dynamics in networks, using agent-based modeling as the method and market concentration and vaccination opinion dynamics as case studies. Keywords include: opinion dynamics, decision-making, agent-based modeling, social complexity. You can find more of my work in [cv]({{site.github.url}}{% link cv.md %}).

I have just graduated from a double-degree PhD program at [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/) (China) and [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) (The Netherlands). [My PhD project](https://hdl.handle.net/11370/a80e2530-098c-4543-8b92-1024b9f59425) explores the collective consequences of bounded rationality in opinion dynamics in networks.

Currently I am a postdoc researcher in an EU project [PREPSHIELD](https://crimedim.uniupo.it/projects/prepshield) - Preparedness for Society in Health Crises and Disasters, focusing on data analysis and simulating how human psychological and social features affect, in separation and in combination, agentsâ€™ behaviors in a health crisis.

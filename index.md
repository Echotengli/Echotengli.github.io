I am now a double-degree PhD candidate at [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/) (China) and [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) (The Netherlands).

[My PhD project](https://hdl.handle.net/11370/a80e2530-098c-4543-8b92-1024b9f59425) explores the collective consequences of bounded rationality in opinion dynamics in networks, using agent-based modeling as the method and market concentration and vaccination opinion dynamics as case studies. Keywords include: opinion dynamics, decision-making, agent-based modeling, social complexity. You can find more of my work in [publications](/publications).

I am now a double-degree PhD candidate at [Huazhong Agricultural University] (https://www.hzau.edu.cn/) (Wuhan, China) and [University of Groningen] (https://www.rug.nl/) (The Netherlands).

My PhD project revolves collective consequences of bounded rationality in opinion dynamics in networks, using market concentration and vaccination opinion polarization as case studies. The social simulation using agent-based modeling is my main research method. You can find a more complete overview of my activities in my [CV] ({{site.github.url}}{% link cv.md %}).

Some keywords related to my research are: opinion dynamics, decision-making, agent-based modeling, social complexity.
